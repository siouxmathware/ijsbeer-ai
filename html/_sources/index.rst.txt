Welcome to the documentation of the ijsbeer ai pipeline!
========================================================

The purpose of the ijsbeer ai pipeline is to enrich historical Dutch texts with useful data.
This consists of four separate modules:

#. String-to-sentence: split input string into words

#. Post-correction:  Correct any presumed mistakes in the HTR for each word.

#. Named Entity Recognition (NER) using BERT.

#. Named Entity Recognition (NER) using lists. This can be defined to only search within the results of the NER BERT.

#. Modernisation of the words. This step is done last so that found entities can be skipped.

Each of these steps is documented in more detail in the corresponding subpackage of the :ref:`lib package` documentation.

Typical usage
-------------

The intended use of this pipeline is that it is containerised and called via POST-requests to the server.
More details on this interface are given in the :ref:`server package` documentation.
Below we present a number of examples of server calls as they might be used by a user of this pipeline.

.. code-block:: python

    server_response = requests.post(
        url=URL + 'pipeline',
        json={"input_data": "Brieven van Cornelis Lardijn, Eindhoven, 25 maart 2021"}
    )
    full_json = server_response.json()
    assert full_json['message'] =='Success'

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:
